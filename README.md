# Procedural Generation with Python and its built-in Turtle Graphics Library.
A simple script that draws a random line. A small example of procedural generation.
(10 lines of code)


## How it works
The script executes a while loop. Inside of it:
- A random number is chosen (between -90 and +90).
- It is set as the turtle's heading (in degrees).
- The turtle draws a random number of pixels (between 3 and 5) in that direction.
